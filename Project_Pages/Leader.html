          <h4>Overview</h4>
          <p>Ever since high school, I've been involved in leadership activities, honing my abilities as a mentor, mentee, public speaker, leader and organizer. These roles allowed me to become a better communicator, better at resolving conflict, and better at understanding and catering to others' needs.</p>

                      <li>In CMU's most selective fraternity, I held many leadership roles, concluding as Vice President of Administration</li>
                      <li>I managed a budget of over $10,000 for a brotherhood of 54, and threw several campus wide events</li>
                      <li>I lead 11 committee chairs, who I worked with to execute their events, and grow as leaders. Many of them went own to have large leadership positions in the org.</li>
                      <li>I used my technical background to develop two applications, one that was a recruitment portal for our semesterly rush, and another to help better our alumni relations</li>

                  <li>Based on my experiences in AKPsi, I wanted to give back to the greater CMU community</li>
                  <li>Since CMU is a smaller school, RAs can focus more on building relationships and less on enforcing</li>
                  <li>I was an RA for 2 years, the second for a residence hall focused on global citizenship</li>
                  <li>In addition to supporting my floor of 35, I also worked with 7 others to create programming, executing 25+ workshops and events each year </li>
                  <li>I created the first website for a CMU dorm, gathering 3500 views in the first hour of launching, and setting a trend for all other residence halls</li>
