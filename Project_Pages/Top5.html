          <h4>Opportunity</h4>
          <p>
         Often times my team of 4 and I found ourselves at restaurants not sure what would be good, especially in a time crunch, or when trying a place for the first time. Top5 was designed to change the way people interact with menus, pulling data from location/ restaurant oriented APIs to find which 5 dishes users liked best, and to project them in a simmple, mobile format.
          </p>
          <p>
          Every week, we had to present to a panel of “investors” (our professors), who would scrutinize each sprint, ensuring that each feature added value to our user base. Because of this, we spent a lot of time doing A/B testing, developing personas, and doing walk throughs with prospectives users, as well as hanging out in restaurants!

          <h4>Solution</h4>
          <p>
            <div>Stack</div>
            We used MongoDB, Node.js, Express and Angularjs with Jade for our final iteration. Original, we started with Ruby on Rails and a Postgres database. We switched to MEAN because it could better handle our API, was better for mobile first design, and was something new and challenging.
          </p>
          <p>
            <div>Iterations</div>
            We used Agile Methodolgy to govern our sprints, deciding each week what we accomplish, and then starting each meeting with a standup to discuss what we would speficially get done. We used Pivotal Tracker to record our progress.
          </p>
          <p>
            <div>User Experience & Research</div>
            Since our app only existed to enhance restaurant goers' experiences, much of our time was spent doing user testing and research. We developed the app using Mobile First Design to make sure we were catering to the ideal experience. We did user walkthroughs very frequently, and A/B testing of features as we built them. To help understand and visualize our uses, we developed Personas to see what demographics liked what. Our final app was greatly shaped by our research, allowing us to make data driven decisions that would add value to each user.
