          <h4>Opportunity</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>ZWP is a non profit that helps businesses and communities reduce their waste</li>
            <li>ZWP came to CMU looking for assistance in how technology could improve their offerings</li>
            <li>After shadowing ZWP employees on an engagement, we saw that their "Initial Waste Audit" was their biggest pain point</li>
            <li>We developed a mobile application that automized their process, making reporting take hours, not weeks</li>
            <li>Our application greatly increased their sales and the value of their mission</li>

                  <li>We began by asking ZWP about what they wanted to improve on</li>
                  <li>We asked to shadow them on an engagement</li>
                  <li>We recorded them, and used Businss Process Modeling to map their workflow</li>
                  <li>We found the biggest paint point was their initial proposal to potential clients</li>
                  <li>This was all done by hand in Excel, so it lacked consistency, quality control, and often took weeks </li>
                  <li>We quickly developed an MVP to show how we could automate and standarize the process</li>

                  <li>We used gems to allow photo to be uploaded to Dropbox, web pages to be downloaded as pdfs, and items to be edited with ajax</li>
                  <li>We used a Postgress database and customized Bootstrap for styling</li>

                  <li>We had him go on a mock engagement twice to test the app in real world settings</li>
